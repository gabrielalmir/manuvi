# 🏭 Manuvi – Intelligent Production Planning Platform

**Manuvi** is a modern web platform that helps manufacturing companies plan and schedule their production operations (PPCP) in a simple and intelligent way.
Rather than replacing traditional ERPs, Manuvi complements them by providing practical tools to simulate, visualize, and optimize production workflows — especially for small and medium industries.

This project is born from the vision to **go beyond ERPs**, offering:
- Visual and interactive planning tools
- Configurable production rules and goals
- Clear insight into capacity, delays and bottlenecks
- An easy-to-use interface designed for planners and managers
