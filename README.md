**Manuvi** is a modern web platform that helps manufacturing companies plan and schedule their production operations (PPCP) in a simple and intelligent way.
Rather than replacing traditional ERPs, Manuvi complements them by providing practical tools to simulate, visualize, and optimize production workflows ‚Äî especially for small and medium industries.
